And That amount would reimbursed back from our company sir So how much will that amount be? Right now my existing customers they are paying a sum of around 1,18000 per month as an interest.

So currently if we look into basic concepts like 100 rupees per month, it will somewhere close to around 8200 from builder side But when ready for moving property definitely another 500 would expect is ready to move in property definitely another 500 will be expected so somewhere like 8500 28700 we are expecting sir that would give a basic increment it's 1000 rupees yes all right let me think over yeah sure thank you","Questions:

That is fine. Another one independent that also back to the front but you can take a car from here and another way You have two opposite directions for driveways actually So whether your getting Back-to,back or Independent Car Parking depends on flat number of cars because we we have all allocated the car parking numbers actually for that respect to unit so manually cannot do anything. So, by default which was flat no.,you chose it? Car Parking is alocated sir while i mean fear free uh let me open it yeah yes okay so in the tower there is In tower B, I am looking at the flats 1 and 2.

Yes Sir correct So other ground floor is under mortgage Right ? Yeah Ground Floor to 3rd it's Under Mortgage Sir The mortgages flats are Available but we Have To pay cash uh no even cast nothing and it's not so that will be opened at the time of position sir oh god what is the best price we could get now like if you go for a loan maker good thing that this project has three emi offers sir. Okay, So That means under construction projects right? Bankers will disburse the amount according to milestones. So you have pay interest part for this was about okay, so till now whatever I explained it's quite common in any project we go payment process and all you an offer in a way that whatever the interest part is paid till we reach 39th floor of respect to your tower. That amount will be refunded back for Say suppose this month some 50,000 got debited from your account on 5th of May What you have to do? You need share that loan statement stating the amount has been deducted In same months itself in those 40-50 thousand 90% will be refund back Another 10 We give your TDS invoice or certificate also okay while filing ITRs can claim the same amount of money sir Okay so it's a kind off rent paying us back? It not exactly EMI offer but its like our Rent You have to show in income only you are taking that back uh right ah yeah If one is working and another not, you can take this pre-MA offer. You keep the nonworking people under co applicant then premium will be credited to them So what is the price you said come again uh eight triple nine sir will be like 2 and a half year sir. The position date is December 25th, okay so what if we pay cash ? If you don't want pre-EMI, okay? You cannot go. So the thing is that we can take cash first of all sir Okay if your like self funding in place bankers happens i mean cash in the sense so we have white amount which will transfer according to your uh schedule yeah if that is a case there'll be no difference sir. In this base price like 899,000 rs., There would 150 rupees discount okay Okay one hundred rupee for SST Yeah That's it So that could come up like a 886 sorry 8849 sir okay eight four nine. That's it, Okay? Yes I mean everything get it. It definitely feels 9000 little premium now because so inside that city there are a couple of flats construction which available till 8k uh, we can avoid to finish but yeah so if you have the relation. Sir like I'm not sure with this project your comparing both surrounding those spectra location all of projects across based by 9000 sir 9250 and9 thousand three and also there are some projects okay we giving nine thousands again it can be negotiated a bit uh... I know that given pre EMI offer so no other project is quoting less than 9900 like tell me and another thing is that like ours it's an outdoor living space balcony concept you know the Balcony It has a room-sized Balkany so its spacious actually Correct correct And location matters alot sir So Location it's in financial district you know this financially sick is like government approved i take quarter zone actually all types of approvals are available actually any pharmaceutical industry can come up okay so including to the amenities you're saying right, corner flat etc is there anything we could negotiate in that?

3," Hello. So sorry sir, the call got dropped I am on same lane can i come and meet you in your office? Yes Sir please Come Please Come to Sheraton Hotel because sales officer is there And we are not at site Because There's Excavation for clubhouse going right now so pls come share location with me'll be sharing the location with you. No but no, otherwise in a shelter not only is there point like and i can speak over before then okay when he's accomplished it? The completion of handover was in 2025 December. I know if you are coming from ISP road or service roads sir? Sir, i am comming over our side.I can see Kalyani building on my right now You have already crossed Western Springs I have come to the uphill area where Kalyani building or your Al Rayno is somewhere stopped at kalyan. No no I am standing right in front of the kalayni ok so Kalanyi if it to you are on Right side then opposite that Sir, left Side You have spectra site ,you can see construction going one yes ASBL Specta oh thats Your Site Is It Yes Sir i cant See a lot Of Digging and all Exactly for That reason we moved into Shelton Yes sir. Okay Sir shall I come down to the side otherwise you want a meeting there? But we don't have place for sit, that is our concern actually. Sitting isnot necessary These towers are at uphill area or how it's elevated because portion of your land seems dug out There s still and slightly elevate also. As you can see there must be two towers which are already in 21st lap So those 2 tower out of 4 basically Yes, exactly. That is where the sales office was earlier so we moved here Tell me a simple question. Compared to upgrade For example first is 1980 which will be one of our main balcony And second side has two balkonys Which double 2 1 0 sft a corner flat If want third 10SFT more, 2220 but floor plan different. There we are having 3 balconies so as u know if ur going upto this side then number of balcony keep increasing otherwise other main highlight in project payment schedule basically Payment Schedule PMI offer and here what happens is that whatever interest you want to pay the banker, The builder will return it back till construction of terrace floor. So for example I mean bankers are not going charge principal for example let us say every fifth of calendar month there will be a debit from your account in same months here last week we are reimbursed upto 90% that amount which was paid and this happens each to happen every month till the construction of terrace floor You don't have anything in 28- 2900 square feet size? No no sir. 2220 is the largest that we had 11-12 feet wide living room width is seem to be little cramping. I love balcony. Bigger balconies are something that i always like Okay. The width itself doesn't... You know, you are right walking into the TV. That's all It is not wide enough that which should be at least 16-18 feet Okay! That as your, uh... You know what I'm going be a carpet area because we are gonna remove the balcony and they're gona move external walls so space inside only out of 12 42 That's why u may find living areas too big off this place. Let say 2000 sft was the size and uh there were you know normal sized bargains that we generally use then,we would have been able to expand it. And a carpet area could be somewhere around 1500 in this case So are other upcoming towers also same sizes? Yes sir like with respect A&D first tower & last Tower That is it? yes Sir like with respect to A and D, first Tower & last Towers that will have 10 flats per floor but where as middle towers B&C are only going 5 flat's for floors otherwise all of them 40 Flows each All Are corner flats as well middle flat with 3 sizes available in them Finance plan is that we can go for 2 years we are not paying anything plus. And whatever interest your upto 90 % reimbursement ,we're giving back so U will get some convenience with respect of time also morning benefits generally what builders we're gonna want to build us the loan give us reimbursement then will offer second 10 percent once pre-MI stop is it possible put on these loan schemes on paper? Is there a working sheet or something that I can get. Sir, actually i will do for you and share the picture of this if its fine then ill be able explain how monetary going to have with respect time also. If u can give me little times sir by 10-15 The Interest is calculated for this twenty four month flat interest will calculate. Correct, so in that case you are not paying principle but only pay your Interest amount and we return back to 90% of it once there's no Principle actually Once the TerraSource lab is completed, then principal plus interest are what you'll have to pay in 9th milestone That was post 21 months Also I've an update for u sir From 1st of July There will be a revised and from 300 to 400 is what we are thinking that how much appreciation it would get. and 300 to 400 is what we are thinking that appreciation will come based on price this besides the pre-MI offer I am talking about got it, i'll call you back meanwhile other details which was sent in whatsapp please have a look into pricing sheet Meanwhile, the rest of details are available on WhatsApp. Please have a look into that pricing sheet and milestone etc And if you require my help then call me at this number Okay done!

8," Hello. Sir, my name is Sajin and I am talking to ASBL Spectra from the financial policy project What's your Name? My name Is sajin Sajin So basically, I just wanted to know if you are aware of the location sir? You're asking my Location or like what ? No no. Are your Aware about Project Locations in ISB sector which is Anakramuda Yes it's financial district then yes so we have two ways To enter into project. One is from ISB road, before going into Boka Pitsar you have a route which takes towards your left and then once across that side there's another one on right handside The other way out of this place goes through service roads So exactly opposite Nanakramuda Toolbooth. So from ISP road I have to come straight till the end and then take right? No sir, once you cross Vipro junction & Varun motor immediately we need a left for signal before going Fishtamandath ,we must go Left Sir Is your Semple flat ready ? no sir December 2025 is the project handover. No, in this no projects. I mean out of four towers two tower you have already completed 26 floors slab and the other 2 Towers which are at entrance we've completely basement 4 And quite an entrances where is clubhouse area were excavation going on According to that We had most family set inside cell But like without seeing how will fit, how we will get an idea of what are going to be? Yeah so basically also have a project which is in coca-paste. Which ASBL spires with it's exactly same only difference dimension actually So inspectorate 1980 there 1905 accepted's 1905 excepted. Quality wise its exactly the same. actual inside the house you are saying yes it as smallest 3BHK right ? Ah yes that's a starting size and ah second sizes how much double 2 Double 2, 1-0. double two one zero and that is... For 1980 you have 1516 right for 2210 How Much Is The Area 1702. And how much per square foot you people are charging right now? 8999, sir 9000 rupees for a safety. Yes Sir This is final or How Is It ? We can work out on the price we have flight negotiation and when visit site Apart from this also offer called as no pre-MI that until terrace floor slab there will be reimbursing to me or you'll reimburse directly? to the bank? So, initially once you pay the 10% amount set we are going to execute an agreement of sale. Based on that bank is disbursing as per work progress No, this is the base price. Yeah yeah so Base Price 8999 then we have floor rise from 7th Floor onwards 20 rupees per SFT Then We Have Corner Premium Charges and Other Rates Builders Wave Off Those Like They Just Say That But While You Come And Take The Padway Wave Of Low Rise Chargers like they just say that but while we come and take the flat, will you charge floor rent? No I don't think so. no builder would do it sir all builders definitely charges for this because clients wish to go upper floors. I purchased a place in Mumbai also. Here is Telangana Sir here at the product do sir because that is good for clients who are looking something high-res. That's a benefit to you as it gives us better view and no mosquitoes so basically its got much more views if we want low flows also there will be flats available So from 7th floor 20 rupees per asset is mandatory sir. G plus 39 floors 22nd floor. So, 20 to the minus 7 will be 16th Floor No're... Sir which floor do we wants then ? Which one? 2322 this time suppose like for example so the flow rate is 710400 So the floor rise will be 7,104 Lakhs. Yes sir for Floor Rise is 70000 Rs How this calculation of seven lakh? You said 20 rupees per square feet. Per floor you are saying? Yeah it's more than what parking or charging rate Sorry Sir And all this can be negotiated once we visit the office ?

I have done it in October 2021. They booked me for the first time on 21st of April and then they took my name off from there. My last book was done at home but we put a pre-launch offer, sir The free launch option was 100% payment You can do it once Sir We sold 90 units at that time and started the loan again That's how much they gave us for those 5,500? We paid 4808 or 4500. All included to 5000. Now how about 8000-5100? It is now 8550 because we are spending 300 rupees every 3 months in each year We have completed half an exact dates because all our complete projects do take extra days and breaks too.

That is my father who did sir, any builder will offer starting off on capital generated income.

Today we pay 10% and when terrace floor gets done then nothing will be paid to us How long does a Terrace Floor target last? 2 years? It takes around two-and half year from Monday till Tuesday After that how much money do you take from the M&A and development? Will they separate it in 2 or 3 years if not taken away. They will separately collect maintenance fees for builders after two-year maintaining. If its corporate funds then it is development. If the builder doesnot take your account will be there.

24," This call is now recorded. I am trying to arrange the amount first of all. Because, as a person who takes money and speaks.. So... One more thing is that my dog has two old loans which are being closed now so it should not affect me in any way That's why if we keep our amounts busy for 3-4 months then only sorting all these out and creating money there's no need for 20% payment in the first time itself. The way our payments structure works here... First 10 % will be 805, then 8lakh 50000 would have to pay for down payment after paying your loan and going back home bank people submit and they give whatever amount is required. The current work rate of 75% has been completed, so remaining 65 percent will be given by banks. Then you can either do self-funding or go for a loan. If there's any problem with your CBLUIL, first pay 10% of the booking amount. You can also do kind of self funding. This option is available If you think that eligibility for loan will be given, there are civil issues so it to 5000 rupees and till march there are 4700 rupees You say when people come on site? We also know about loan issues or civil issue as well there may even a banker for us I have applied for a home loan. Before going to the builder closed these loans ,i still have 3 more to reject this will again be a negative impact? It's tiny! My last 6 months back was rejected already by Jan Laplace Okay okay.. I did my homework earlier. It is great to think about it and do without knowing anything else I also arranged for a down payment. But, my main situation is to get loan from them. Why do they ask me? Because... ...I am in Hyderabad proper with our own house only! Okay..okay..! All these are taken under investment and tax savings alone. They rent those houses out. Just small things like that. Simply doing some interior work as neat interior work is done by the dentist I am in touch with it Ya Sir! Nice idea sir That's why we are asking for 2 points A middle class family whose wife & husband has been here since 50 years When there was an old mother or father, they should take the place. 3BHK will be placed in one middle class family for long time and that rent would not go low 2 BHk also gets reduced It's little are there? 1475 sir. I always ask one thing, how much is the cost of 3rd floor and 2nd floors with a carpet area in it? Carpet Area 1134 Sir! Why do we need to have an apartment at this place for that purpose only because they will be available from here only. Yes, sir! That is why i told you clearly. Ok? For me it should be 3-4 months for the situation to improve more than a year Because civil service and home loan has become very important now. Since my salary account was with ICICI bank so when my salary is also there. So, when we go to the ITC Bank then only they apply for it at home Then our situation will be different. Now in market if you are getting a good pay or your payment would not work out then that's why we cannot do anything Don't think of any suggestion just because i faced something like this so i am saying what will be used. Just for my knowledge, but don't think that i'm telling you this because of it There is a customer named Sudhakar who took me to him He also has the same issue with SIBIL But when he goes there and sees rate-of interest What they are For example if they give 8% to all our people then for those who have civil issues 9%,8.,5%. Even if you have a civil issue, even after increasing the rate of interest they are still doing loan sanctions. Maybe there is an idea like that so please see it once. What I mean to say was clearing your bills would be wonderful because If my bill isn't good now at least in future best loans will come That's what i wanted sir Actually one was that I am not even eligible for home loan as you said. Yes sir okay. In any bank in which... Let me tell directly to a person who has closed his account with someone else. Okay The same other banks gave credit card 9 years back and when they do dues without any need. Yes, yes sir! So that is what bank gave me personally but now in a salary account there are some loans which have been cleared by taking those loan. That was how i settled it with financial situation at first time. Yeah Sir! It came happened during the Corona times right? No its back to 12 years ago. Ok Sir sorry. What happend then is we didn't have much salary and commitment so i couldnot manage but now.. We had more income opportunities But closing those paths... It wasn´4 months, then my civil issue will be cleared and cash the flat for me in market. So, during these 3-4 months we need to clear guard this and make a down payment on that place. And when will they give it? No idea because there is no rule about staying at their house's why they are looking for investment purposes only. Yes, that is it! Actually apart from this if there was a small land and when the money comes in 5 years time then we will see whether or not banks give us income mortgage loan Ok Sir! Then one.. When did you say? My way of thinking would be I will not face any problem even if it's difficult. If you come to me with your own now, if that investment is better or this one... Land has been given more cost and the loan will be good for me as well. Right sir! This month was in June? Yes Sir! So can you want me to finish the test? September. I will be ready by then. Right sir! Thank You Sir Not an issue sir because now that we have explained in depth how much planning have planned and solved the problem. You will get to know about it according your method of explaining. That is my inspiration for me sir Thankyou Sir One more thing, please call this number at any time. I will call you once.

Open 3rd page of your profile. You can see Google banks in it, right? Yes If you zoom into ICICI bank and look at those high rise towers below them is a blue color one That property, office space. That's ISB Road No, it's 500-600 meters. It will be 1 and half kilometer from here. We have a right side project on the way This total 785 acres of land Where does that go straight ? There are 12 booths in Nanakram Where is this road going? It is 300m from Colgate. We took a U-turn at Mayamavatar and then we made our project in the next left for another less than three hundred meters I can understand now. Starting size is from 1980. We are getting more concentration in balcony than the other two. So we enjoyed the morning sun rise and evening sunset in our balcony. We gave a 9-11ft size to that concept of living room, And also provided bedroom sizes for it. Almost there is bedroom sized? Yes almost 3x7 type beds are available here This was actually one such concepts Our clubhouse has a very luxurious look Why did you give it square and not in corners? For the looks What do u mean by that? The balcony That's for elevation sir, to see outside It will be good a planter box here to keep plants and other things inside as well. Okay okay.. How much will sir it is a hybrid plant but you can keep as much height and size of your choice How many Feet will be our floor ? 10ft How is your planning? I have two plans. You only tell me, to settle down payments in one month. Or do we have the Loan Payment option and decide on how much of that will be paid out as per our needs Yes sir! So first thing here is 100% no repayments are required You know right, not every company has this kind offer One way would've been home loans Another possibility was if they were done by to the work progress of your organization. In this project, 30% of the 60 lakhs. These 6lakh should be paid now. Again sir in every 3-4 months or 5month we will complete each payment milestone slab I'll give an estimation for it In between those times from three 4 month's only after paying this is one option Or can go home loan If not, then we will give 3-4 months time and in between that period I'll make the payment That's right It would be done after paying for three month or fivemonths Yes How much amount does each installment cost? 10 lakhs per install. The flat cost of this unit was Rs2 Cr, so it will be 10% for the total price and 20 Lakh rupees in our case. What about 9080SFT ? All these together would make around two crores including AMMETIS , Base price and GST will be 2 crores. How much is the base Price? 84999 sir of limitations in units and we are having good places in this city. We have a direct outdoor view and sunrise views of the flats here. If we visit these sites once, I will show visit you. How many flats do you have? All of them are 1186. Is a swimming pool sufficient for so much people ? Yes, it is enough sir because everyone has their own area to swim in and they don't want the new arrivals having problems with that They will pay rent for the entire time, but they are not paying it. Will that be enough? Yes sir! Swimming pool is big and kids can play in there too they work from morning to evening and even at home. We are also doing something like clubhouse or MNTs but we should survey it first Why do you need swimming for us? For give indoor swimming pool, gym Supermarket, pharmacy and ATM 4 guest rooms Party hall 200k per system All these are necessary for everyone sir How did this supermarket tie up all of them? Sir! How does the super market tied it with what is happening here? That's more important giving one type of vendor as a pharmacy and we also give big vendors. Who gives bigger ones normally sir? No, no.. Bigger brands only. Pharmacy is still getting better at any time. That's our concept. Our our club, they are doing a big architect design for HP Luck and all celebrities like that too So we have already done such an architecture in two months drawings will be coming to us We have a site concept international contract based in Singapore. How much is this? SFT for Rs 8500 per sft It is ready to go up sir. Is it now? Yes, in November month. There are 15-18 flats available there What floor will you get from here Sir? Lower floors only. So below 7. It will be around 4-5% Okay okay. If everyone has a high rise then you can... You should also take some advantage of this because we have done investment in view for long term investments so when doing that taking the views as target would not hurt much since there are sunrises and sunset too right? Taking higher floors gives. Yes sir! Always use the high floor as we have 40 more and 20 plus is our current price point. Not even 25 but around 35% of this cost? We are available from 32nd Floor towards Outer Ring Road to Sunrise units etc.. Once in a while 27th or so can come directly at us. Is there any one like units in Spire. There are low rise apartments for this unit only Where do you live? I am Gachibowli, work-from home. Ok ok, so now do not go to your hometown? Yes sir, but since it is a workflow homie this time round we cannot come here. So did they plan for 25th or 27st today? We will be coming on the 24 th. That's what he said definitely! If i don't leave tomorrow morning then please remember that its Saturday morning, on 27th... Ok ok no problem. I'll come there. Please save this number and if any doubts call me then i can clear them for sure. Sure sir Thank You Sir If 100% payment is done here how much did they give? 8000.. How many were given in that amount? They gave 80000 finalized with the quoting price. You go home alone right? Yes Home Loan? I mean, we could pay that way only. Why did you take a particular plan for it when its about to be done at your place of work? Because if they do this then there is an offer which will run on interest reimbursement What's That ? Interest Reimbursements means If you want to get into bank loans and maximum 80% would come as Lone So 20 % So, from that 20%, only about ten percent is paid by booking advance. Another two years later we can give another 2-3 year payment for this provision. Not just twenty per cent but also a tenth of it and then again in next few months. Now what are doing to make them do so? we will do an agreement. After the Agreement, Bank disburses 80%. As I told earlier 20 % of work is done so first pay only this much but after that bank does a 40 lakhs. When you say this, it means that we are paying interest free be treating everyone as 3 ETS. Ok So your offer has been given a little bit? Sir basically why did I grant this Offer now continuous clients are coming to me 5-6 clients who rent out 5-6 times a day. So, when they go home and face problems... This is an additive moving project so it takes 2 1⁄2 years to get done. It's getting boring here as well. Yes! The offer runs for close of Rs1 point over. If we don't want the offers then at least give us extra discount if we don't have any offer. That's right, that is the thing. Sir let us discuss once and then you will get all details clearly Okay sir okay perfect yeah thank You sir! Did they sent it to me? Yes Sir! They have already done that. You can save this number and call us anytime if there are any further questions. What do we need these phone numbers for? I like ASP's number more than those phones. No no... Please use my college name now. OK Sir!! Thankyou so much Sir!!!","1. Questions:

39," Hello? Very well sir, so before I go ahead with the project details just wanted to understand if you are aware about this projects location? Yes its near About uh... Silted specifica right Correct correct So basically Sir total land area that we have is of 7.85 acres on which were coming up 4 towers each tower will be a G plus 39 floors and in entire entire project we only have three BHK apartments. Okay? And, uh...the basic size that you'd like is 1980 SFT & biggest one's 2220 So can I understand what exactly would your you are saying? Yes yes square feet requirement sir. Then what do have ? 1980 is the basic Sir and 2220 SFT Is biggest size that we Have With 2300 You get two additional balconies or with 190 oh but then, We Have a very unique concept of outdoor living balcony so what one nine eight zero You Will Get One Big Balcony So That Balkany Would Be as big As to the Size Of A Rope okay and What is The price you are quoting on that? The base would be 9000 rupees per SFT and an overall pricing for 1980 will around 2,1 CR wherein a 2220 will cost about 325 cr including 5% GST as well but I believe there is a scheme going on right for you it's 8000 square feet no,no so basically sir just wanted to understand if your okay with timeline then because we are coming upwith new project in close too...as u mentioned closed Pachetika from spectra this project would be located 500 meters closer okay the spec drive already launched right yes petro is now we are launching a new So there is a pre-booking or something from, uh... Prelaunch offer should be the right? Yeah. so The Pelaunce price would 7999 per SFT sir At launch ,the Price will revised to 8500 The Launch prices are at 8500 In case currently let's say we're taking EOY Techs If you interested for that in That Case the case, price would be around 8000 rupees 7999 basically. So only this is a benefit or there's no amenity charges? No Amnesty Charges everything will give us as benefits we get on base prices because based pricing something which actually cost you more when we compare it with amenities and floor right now that I think so if i pay me about 50 lakhs do they getting benefit of them no sir surprising remains in ok No sir, the pricing will remain same. that is an interest reimbursement. Since we have, it would be under construction project so after the agreement of sale bank will dispersing funds based on constructions stage So whatever fund they are disburses in base to this Bank charge you certain amount every month Now what he do doing here In same one when interests charges have share this statement with us and after u do that before month ends we reimbursed 90% of your amount back. This until a Interest Amount Why 90 % not 100 %. The 10 would be tds that down our office let's sit and discuss on it. Where is? Sorry! Sir where are your offices located at Sheraton Hotel on 10th floor. In financial district opposite to ICICI Bank Yeah I know it's a hotel but can we meet tomorrow afternoon? Ya ya sure sir you give me visit before coming and just call the same number My name Rahul I can share it with you because for the new project we are awaiting RERA however, We have received HMD approval but once get rera.we will launch So since don't know about this yet i won' be able to show details currently so that is a reason why am insisting if u give us visit then discuss in detail ok and ill come tomorrow Okay. Fine, I'll come... Sure sir! is fixed or it can be negotiated? The 7999 the price would be 8,000. Again that will not negotiate but in case if you want to discuss on pricing for Spectra we can work out of a present part sir If it is based off prices then some kind or amenities something like this could reduce because anyway are going forward I understand Sir That's why you are getting a 500 rupees of exclusive Euro benefit before the launch? That is what we would be having two sizes for one point six and then cost will come around 1 .9","

45," Hello. Yeah, ask me that I Can help out with all the details Okay actually so When we pay a 7% down payment So when Will be an experiment start that's what i wanted to know okay? The payment plan that we have is 10-8010. Okay? First, you make the downpayment of ten percent That's when your agreement on sale will be executed After which 80% would become home loan Bank starts disbursing funds based upon construction stage One...the terrace slab for respective towers Let us say there are four in this project So whichever tower you buy Once it has been completed So basically sir currently tower A and Tower B are at 4th basement slab so that will take about 18-20 months for the terrace to get completed. Wherein Tc & D is already sitting in 25 level of a flat fifth level slab okay so uh At the time of position I want to go for home loan. Till that, till initially i want actually what I understood if pay 10% now and later after 18 months,I can paid remaining ten percent. And the further remain thing ,i will be going on a Home Loan Is it possible like this? No no It's not Possible Like That Sir What you Can Do Once You Make Ten Percent of down payment we will have your agreement at sale executed after which lets say if buy unit in tower A or Tower B so until then whatever amount has to be paid and than aftr this,we construction so based on constructions it you can make the payment sir. So how when I expect an experiment if they paid 10% now, then what is next? Sir If You Make a ten percent Now Then Overall 40 % would be due right only because yeah...so i will share my payment milestone with you sir that is when and then going forward you will have 3 months to 4 month of difference, To make again that part payment. Okay so... You mean say initially at least within span for three or four moths I had pay 50% right? Yes more-or less yes sir So..to better understanding Sir you can give us visit our office we will discuss on this. Our sales offices in Sheraton hotel which is another option right pre EMI offer what it that? Correct correct That's for home loan if you go to a Home Loan then the Pre-EMI would be applicable.

Sure sir my name is Rahul you can always call me back on the same number whenever your coming so before comming if u just let know i'll plan m day accordingly and uh...the price bracket for new project would b e we have two sizes in that again all three PHKs one wil around 1700 which cost 1 point 6 where in the biggest size would be 1900 that'll costs about one point eight during yeah,during pre launch which is a Pre Launch at launched prices get revised so I can only share it to you once your here sure sir i'm there on Saturday or some day. At what time you will come usually?

So we are taking this time to conclude everything We will definitely do that What I want is if you come in a way See..I understand You wait multiple visits for people's pulse check But what I mean is that if You can tell me the best figure outright it would help in my trade down because Prestige quoted 8200 with negotiables Ok ok So for me before this also i found Western as opposed I also found Western before that. My opposite That too is all inclusive for me because they have just started They are giving a better deal Sir, it's not wrong to say every builder has good things But don't take Western considerations as the reason is because Prashti Janlur and Radha Pusam are very well but you have to be a little more western basically Have they seen any of their residential projects before?

I am not saying that we have 7 executives in our company If you meet anyone You will get 100 rupees now But if they come to us directly They can give a good deal at once Because even customers do n't like to turn the customer. Exactly, my opinion is that I am already doing market research and know how fair your deal will be because previous prices are following you as SBL pre-launched so i have some idea about price trend but waiting for better deals Definitely sir, you are one customer only Any customers close the same deals and do it If they come to our site we will give them all final price Customer waste time It is not okay because this job We don't have any problem But the customer is not a single product. We are also looking at it, right?

That's available now There are no roads in our section What about road positioning Sir, if you look at that position for another 5 months it will be entirely different If you see it in another 5 months, It will be entirely different. There are some very serious reasons why this has to constructed within Andover Because of RERA which have given us the permission based on road size The roads that open tomorrow there is a lot pressure Chiranjeevi's 60 acres of land. He is only set up for movie sets His influence exists there Opposite Rajapakse people are launching a new property There also political involvement from all over the country Until recently, suddenly we started acquisition and shifting our borders HMDA has also put up boards and said that the work on Andhra Pradesh road started towards Neopolis There are so many developments If you just come out of your house, any project will be correct for you You can sit inside once Because we stay here 24x365 days So know exactly what is going to happen. So if you're free, come and stay for one more day My name's Surya sir Is this price still there? We can have a discussion once There are water tanks too They will fill the tank with I don't know If we do not get that It would dry up Government won' t If the water pipe is not there, it will dry up. That's why government doesn't put a pipeline like that They say road should be built on top of underground or bridge The plan for building such roads exists This same system goes from Gandipet to city centre You call Manjeera pipeline connection and other connections That's a high level of Water So we could find some beds in few places but not many How much does Neopolis have? 800m Near my property there are both near chirenji & neapolis It has about 8 hundred meters Near my property is Chiranjee and near that side Neopolis. 800 meters Ok, so there will be 100% development in the neopolises? Sir if you have been on this road for 2 years then how would know it Now just look at those roads 150-200 feet long They are buying land with 60 auction for 60 crores. My home builder bought a house of 50 acres, already commercial space started We're nearest essential tower to them Asset value information will be in next level At same time we'll have Neopolis's center.

I came for marriage 10 days later he arrived You may come anytime any day morning 10 to evening 5 I am not sure if you are aware of this road Why did they say that it is a land acquisition? When we came here, Land Acquisition was done 18 days ago They gave us 1 month time line We have been given 30 permission after writing 30 feet in books of records Now they came to take it, our compound wall is also behind by thirty-feet Because my actual company walls are not that These days you used up before because there was no space Otherwise now how much did I come Otherwise we have reached the end. So you can see both sides, if it is already working then start There will be a bridge like thing there and that work has also started When this time comes clearly your idea should come sir Once again go to Mercedes We shall decide on date once after coming here What are our plans status of your construction? Sir, if there are 6 months left in handover we will be done with that Compound walls & club house light painting work How many flats do you have ? 393 No joke Okay I am leaving how the Rastak Pandal? It is same rate there and here, they buy land today Buy cement for this day & iron it Today's rent rate is like this, today cement rates are same and iron prices also the similar. We have another property in financial district but half of it has not been completed yet But how much we had here? Because I landed after 5 years so our budget got reduced Now project was complete that means there will be less Since no part or other projects were done then due to high cost we have less money there is no half of the project so due to that cost, rates are high So if you want in 6 months this will be enough or I can buy ice pencil and pen If it's better for me then plan accordingly Today market last six month launch projects at peak No Nobody thought about that rate and it is there Since this came to handover, we have no one less than us who can give a turnover of another six month That's all I am saying openly Along with pre-MA offer ifMA offer then interest will be refunded to your account In which we don't have East facing or West Facing charges And there is flat on floor 35.

Sir by Premium what mean that the Spectra Is at prime location so The amenity part When comes in It would be compared to Spire Over and above to spire over and above that the fixtures or fittings would be slightly better than what we have given Or same brand which is in Spires Why so? Reason being as I mentioned Firstly, sizes are on a higher part at spectra Firstly, secondly. The thing Is That since it's not prime location sir and there 1186 apartments all together so we won't compromise Let say if We're giving jaguar or kohler first fire If something better Let's say if we are giving Jaguar or Kohler for Spire, If something better is there. We will give that a spectra? It would be similar... Will you also allow me to just add my cousin on this call ? You want him added in the phone calls ?? Yes yes Sure sir ,you can do it Okay hold Hello. Yeah Mahati also holds the end rahula here would he have Me yes sir I can Hear You okay so i've Also Mark my cousin on this call her name is mahatty hi mam Okay So yeah Raoul we're kind of inquiring about both spectra and fire right And Mahti My first question question to rahool was that which community do you suggest among the two And Raoul saying if timeline is six months then spires If have time on hand than spectre Apparently spectrum much more in terms design features Sir sorry I lost you somewhere the voice wasn't audible. Yeah so, i was saying that your suggesting Spectra is much more a freemium for Design & Specifications Right ? Correct sir For example if You want ,I can give You a comparatively About Spire and Spectra a well-known architect called as Mr. Lakhwani, he is designing the clubhouse at Spectra wherein we are giving 24000 SFT to Spire But then you're looking 392 units versus 1196 So for 392 unit 2100 Club house Correct sir Wherein compared with spectra and spires Spire would be a bigger community And the size also at Spectre starts from 1980 SFT Wherein, At SPIRE it start's form 1905 Now another thing that Sir In case if you consider Okay There are inventory available But most of inventories Are avaliable these lower floors. If it is not a problem, you can consider SPIRE if your looking something higher side or as per what we prefer then in this case Pectra has an Inventory Available Got You! Maat any questions so far? Yeah! So Rahul just mentioned that probably the team would help us with EM interest right if we are looking for home loan like I mean if the you know suppose just in case it gets extended for few more months then is going to be applicable with interest also or do we need pay after committed date sure mam i will explain that as well so basically at SPIRE what are doing well so basically ma'am at Spire what we are doing is, At spires We have given a pre EMI until the handover Okay for example let's say if The Handover time gets extended then in that case you will only Have benefit because Would be reimbursing it to You okay unless and Until get Hand over If getting Extended It'll Be taken care of Right Correct That Is What If the shedding is extended, it will be taken care of right? Correct. Wherein at Spectra ma'am we have same pre MI scheme but until completion for terrace slab respective towers Now how this function I'll explain in very simple way So as spectro spire mam We've a down payment 10% As soon you make ten percent your agreement sale happen at Spectra or Spire ma'am we have a down payment of 10% as soon As you make it ten percent off the on-payment your agreement Of sale will happen. Okay, okay then that sorry this is only for spectram and For spires It would be 20%. Since its closer to handover And milestone has been reached A certain stage so coming back To spectrum once You do with an of down payment your agreement will be executed then after that You would go for loan, loans per Loan is dispersed by bank based on construction Once Bank disburses funds For Construction The interest starts getting charged to you. And how we would be doing it? The bank with deducted amount from your and in same month share those statement what are . What do , reimburse back Okay got So Rahul so maximum inventory available okay all right got it so Rahul what is the maximum in inventory available spectrum? Maximum as you are asking about overall or availability part. In terms of SFT, What's a max area that It is 2220 SFT ma'am. Okay, and how much would that cost approximately? Ma'ma Approximately all inclusive it will Cost you around 2 point 3 CR okay And You said we need to pay Around 10% of the down payment right Correct mam of the down payment right correct ma'am okay sure and how about this can you uh tell us something very similar in terms spire also like what is a maximum sft available we need to pay and what would be the down payment? Ma'am, Spire. So again ma'm The sizes of floor plan are pretty much similar At spires highest size is 2120SFT Okay And apart from that See mam We're handing over project in month November Downpayment 20% 80 % you can offer loan apart from That, You will have a pre EMI benefit until The handover. So what would be approximate amount we should possibly pay like after completion entire Amount if I may ask Our estimated figure on a EMI part ma'am no the total amont that i wanted to know for 2120 correct mam it would be somewhere around 1.95 TR all in close F closer for fire is it director okay what's the first question set at spire per a 70 rate in 7699 seven six nine my ok and spectra spectrum eight four nine nine there's a lot of difference this is the project being sir option is more compact. You will have most of the things available within, you know your 5 km radius at Spectra So Kokapet has nowhere less right? I mean kokpets Neapolis and probably Most upcoming location in Hyderabad Correct sir but The land rates are different Sir financial district If correct sir but the land rates are different financial district if you ask me per acre wise, Financial District is around 18 crore something like that I can check and get back to on this So this EMI thing, that's the interesting part. You are saying it remembers interest right? That doesn't depend on your take Correct sir Also OAT is 2 point 3 CR and you're paying 10% which about 23 lakhs Roughly around Sir It depends on which unit you choose and Which floor You chose because that's the other factors That matters On The pricing part It can cross 2.3 CR also Which one Sir? Are u saying Is in Cross Two point three C R Also If U Select A apartment 39 So then of course Will Cross Amount Reason being Of Floor Rise Would be Charge Wherein if on 39 so then of course it will cross that amount reason being a floor rise would be charged wherein if you consider something between 28 from 15 floors onwards to let's say 25th or the 8 th, It'll fall within this range only. Okay and If we go below Say 16 Floor than its less Than That Yes sir Its matters basically price Basically Matters because Of The per then it should be less than that. Yes, sir It matters basically Sure sir, in case if you wanted to come for discussion at office so I can probably share. Tell me something is there any scope or negotiation that your offering? Yes we would be working on the pricing and what it meant So actually have a description of price once u came into our offices you come to the office. Secondly, sir we have our sales Office now settled in Sheraton Hotel We've moved from site of sheraton hotel and operating here on 10th floor Got it One last question from my side See now that Kokopiat is most of upcoming locations there's a lot construction happening around right? Lot coming So if we were to an apartment in Spire will be very noisy Will dusty and all because you don't want situation where You know We are struggling To stay there Because pollution dusts & noise Sir see my frank opinion would Be whichever location You consider financial district Or coca-cate or let's say something In telapur the construction Are happening sir they Would problem That he face or let's say something in Telapur, the constructions are happening. So there would be a problem that you will face wherein my suggestion to consider is location which has already developed In case if we're looking for end use purpose By End Use what I mean it that you want yourself to get settled in yeah sure okay but incase if we're looking for some sorry so your handing over spire on december 2023 whats the going rent from january 2024. basically currently around basically currently in coca-cola the rent around that location for a 3 BHK is going on 40,000 45 thousand okay and after this also sir I am not very certain if they're rental would be somewhere but it will increase eventually however Itwill Be Around 50 to 55 Thousand For A Three BHk In That Location And Again Price Rental income matters because of the Location so we have Ashoka Liviano which is located on service road outer ring Road In That Sir, For A Three BHK Rental Incum Is Around 55 Thousand income is around 55,000 that people are paying wherein we have couple of more options surrounds spectra where in a 3 BHK the total amount that you have quoted right approximate amounts does include GST registration and all other costs or it is just a flat price but your quota mom includes everything including gsts The Registration part will only come during handover, That's excluded in Price. Okay so there will be we'll have to bear extra prize for registration then correct would in such gated communities right the price that they charge would also include by default i was just thinking whether you have combined everything or uh mom whichever builder the registration part region being current it today's day The Registration is around 7.6% so, It might get increased that time right So we don't increase at where in compared of total cost Apartment Correct ma'am excluding GST value on it so there is a 5% EST to understand its better ma'am I my suggestion would be come give us visit probably we can then discuss one another question now the amount that percentage you said but need in beginning 20 percent Is this like based of what we would be getting from the bank or you know 20% Is a fix, That You're Looking at? Oh Ma'am as in The Down Payment. Yeah It's A down payment part so just In case if We are able to get uh loan Uh Maybe Around 90 % Or So know maybe around 90 percent or so the down will gradually decrease right correct you don't have to pay as a Down payment. So how is this being bifurcated 20% Is it an amount that we are looking at Or based on loan? Once shortlistam, You need to make payment of 3 lakh rupees that is token amount. Okay? To block this units so when we blocked That Unit will have 15 days time in these 15 Days Ma'm your loan eligibility would be checked and The Loan part And documentation Part Would Be done as soon As This completed Ma'MaM as soon this is completed ma'am and that when you need to make a within the 15 days,you will have 10% off down payment which we'll include your 3 lakh rupees of token amount. Then it's 7 Lakhs basically okay no-no ten percent total amout right? Correct so in case if Sibyl and your eligibility then, In that You just have to make a 5% of down payment including the token amount And remaining 90%, can be offered for loan The rest After completion There is milestone I will explain it Once we discuss cost sheet So It becomes 9 $ 595 plan currently It is 108010 Plan We will have meet and discussed more about this because anyways i see That's why paying around 20% already Because initially Will be Paying The token amount Then Is going To Be 10 % Of Total Cost And You said because initially we will be paying the token amount then it is going to pay 10% of total cost and you said later after my phone, We'll being again certain percent off our money. So excluding all this what's get from bank so I'm some over me think like they're already 20 % on their Total Amount Already but need discuss about it I'm not getting through phone maybe. Sure ma'am hence, i am suggesting you if can probably between today or tomorrow whenever available give us a visit at Sheraton hotel ill be here only and are avaliable from 10-630 ok sir to 630. Okay, sir we are looking in case We get like this property right? He definitely look out for negotiation also so that is there So he will talk about it Ma'am There would be a room For negotiations To Be very frank on This part But That could only Done once you're here ma'm okay Sure Raul Thanks Arjun I think once you're here ma'am okay sure thanks i think that is my question yeah so thank Thank You, between fire and spectra what seems the best we have to also discuss because one Correct. And One more thing in case if Correct and one more thing saying is if you just want to understand how what would be the type of construction? And I mean, however end product look like The quality then in that case. You can go visit aspire So we have a model flat at spire so That we have a look and in spectra the lower units are still available right uh rahul oh ma'am see mam to be very honest at spectrum We already sold about 78% of inventory. There Are few Units Available apart from that tower B on The master plan if you See Ma'm Tower b recently opened if you see ma'am tower B we recently opened. Sorry Rahul, I lost your... Sir!I was saying that Tower-B in Spectra If You See for That We started taking booking very Recently So..We have lower floor units available in tower B. Okay, got it In SPIRE high unit are not Available is what you're saying right? There a few Units that I don't Have the availability of Spire so i cannot confirm anything but if You want to can arrange call back from spira team When they come to meet You We Can Talk About both fire and Spectra Fire Force also Meet us Right?

73," Hello? that you're in Bombay so just wanted to take an update. So I heard about this loft project, which has been recently launched? Correct Actually i am planning on going with one property because it is near Gachi Boli and Ita City as well correct ? Yeah ,Correct When will the estimation for handover of these properties be done Raulul? The last project will be handed over in December 2026. What's your SFT quoting at present ? It costs Rs 8500 per sft 8,499. Is this a fixed or is there negotiation chances? No no This's the Fixed price sir Okay because I am planning to go through the brochure and everything or will you like me to share it on the github? I checked over your website brochures, It was not able download. If u don't mind can U Share my brocher details And also how much this is going cost for How many floors are there in a tower Its G plus 45 floor structure sir 40-45 i'm planning go with 30-35 floor. 95699 have a look at it and then once you are available after that, let me know. Then we can discuss in detail over the call because this will give better clarity for which particular unit do have a clear reason to go with my budget that My Budget is actually 1.4125 Is the maximum budget Actually So That's why i ask you because there are two kind of property overthere One 16 something or 17 And other one 19-20 SFT. To kind of 3BHK Yeah so 1695 & 1870 correct So as per my budget I think that 16 95 should come under My requirement Okay what did you say your Budget budget altogether sir? correct i understand that sir however uh to be very honest at loft if you consider a unit on 11th floor an all-inclusive price including the extras five percent gst only this is a registration part which it excluded, It will come close to about 1.72 cr sir Including All The Charges Mercenaries charges on 11th floor Oh but you i believe with launching day itself your ceo or I don't know who was there he said very clearly that if this is convenient for IT people and investment or 1.4 I guess And because Rahul am going with 40% cash part See what i would suggest you sir basically rather than making down payment we have a no pre-MI scheme, which is for... I don't want to go through Bajat Finance using that, they are very stupid. And not blaming anyone there is no reason to do this so i don't want...I just wanted the core bank like ICIC or on board, sir. However we do you guys actually did a great job i know they're having more commission with this thing but very friendly speaking how could it, How maxima I can extend my budget to 1.5TL right again coming into one point seven is really tough deal for me that's why he said then better when your going share the price because apparently wasting time and mind too. I understand that sir, what i'll do is... sorry you to go with 11th 12 30. Because she's from Mumbai and all together her flat on 40 floor so what shes saying that whatever the plat it at least he wanted a 70% higher like if its 14 floors then she will be interested in 13 plus one So I'll send your call sheet sheet for 40th floor have look at it. It's just to give an estimation of the landing cost and after in case if u think want later partially close loan then only will get benefit of it What's rate for finance? It 8% or 7%. But my bank giving me one as a corporate employee right.. My Bank offering I understand that sir. 10 to 20 lakh rupees. Hello? Yeah, Pari! Yes sir... Can you share with me the details of Bajat Finance that I am going through How should be my payment plan and how much do i need pay for this and how it's going understandable i believe this is also possible with your property right can you do that yeah so This only that this the benefit you are getting is on price which 8499 per SFT however, management in a discussion to divide there's no need for flow rise charges. There're Flow Rise Charges Yes Sir! Is it? yes sir So we didn't get any benefits from here right ? I mean should have got something like pre-launched So, we didn't get any benefit from this. We should have got something like that if it was pre-launched just to maximize you know sir in financial district If You see an average price base when the Average is coming out It's about 9500 between 9500-100000 per SFT All builders in this close vicinity are offering We have only given a benefit at launch that when price of 2500 we were looking an overall hike 10 lakhs roughly on all prices So initially ,we kept 8499 for sft and now will revise 10 and a half lakh on the overall project so initially we have kept eight four nine Yes, this is from the beginning. This going on. But now it will be revised too sir starting from next month these prices are being revised because you will add flow risers in 8499 also plus if we want facing charges then I don't need it sir, no more charging for the east and west We are giving AC copper piping for all three bedrooms along with the living room. How much is the price of this? I need that one. Okay, understood! Sir you can see the paper and send it to me in evening. You are right Rahul if we could get a discount for this then i will do something because let's say... It is difficult to explain Tel discount then what management has done is that there should be no ambiguity between the buyer and builder or among buyers so Management itself said we follow uniform pricing structure, at the price you are taking our CEO's relatives also take it so there is no scope for discount If they had given a little bit of scop I would have told them on call sir this much and final but i don't have it. If we talk about Spectra, only difference if you buy a 1590, it will be in corners because that's straight stretch otherwise I'll, that we take then in this two things pluses can be obtained One thing your door has wall as there would have lift lobby of door opposite your doors and secondly you can get an outer ring road view from outside as well And even if the play is 40 plus But when it's left lifted people would come in but that doesn' t matter much I also live within gated community. My lift lobby is not exactly, it's slightly away but yes you don't know that much anyway Yes, I am saying the same thing. If you basic vasto is followed in all projects. I am not saying any benefit I have a photo of the site, if upload progress videos every month. So if any project or video is to be seen, then once open the asbl's youtube page... I saw that link on your site Yes sir, all these projects will easily accessible for you But in my previous video there was no 100 ft road in that video where AVL building is being constructed, there will not be a hundred feet of roads. Where sir? Spire one right! Yes Sir it's 40 ft as now and one but not yet sir. It will take 1-1 and a half years because they have started to make this wide only now so that would be taking around year or two for construction means till handover gets done you'll get fully accessible roads I'm sure we can find these on paper right? This thing about getting those hundred footed streets there are definitely hundreds. Sir, it's an approved one like our ASBL spire which was on Kokapet at time when we started construction overthere some way means completely bare now GHMC has start to broadening and after handover you can see all of them within 6-7 months because Because we have the approved layout, right? We know our management first Then only I can promise like this Sir you took it but there is a street left No no sir It's such a case You will get 100 feet only It's just that the name of this place has been changed because we are living in these big flats and you have to cross many streets for Hyderabad So it won't be possible Sir I don' t think there would ever happen any financial district where people can see so much street No man! Even i am from hydrabad have not been to Madhapur. It is far away in financial district but near high tech city. Sir this wasnt planned for you right? This Financial District is a Planned Location. Yes its your plan and we can assure that tomorrow there will be 200 feet of land here And today as well 2 cars got stuck in 30ft. No no that will not happen sir I can assure you this much of this number on WhatsApp.","1. Questions:

87," Hello Good morning ma'am. I am Devendra speaking from financial district of ASB, Ashoka village Yes sir Are you looking for a 3bhk apartment in the same lane? yes Any particular sizes ma'am that you are preferring because we have two projects in financial district, same lane. How much is the project and specifications we will see. Is it okay with ma'am to go upal pocharum? Because, you are looking at Gatchibowli side also. No It should be nearby near by Where is loft here ? Loft was financialistic When did your projection come out? 2026 December When was the first section? Did you start it already? Hasn on your bank. We are refunding that amount of your interests until when we complete our 45th floor slab for this particular tower and then in 2 years time during their contract period they'll give us a loan on which I can repay them with my money So that will be an advantage ma'am. Around the cut-in, I would benefit also But it is 1 point 75? Yes including 2 car parking amenities GST and maintenance excluding registration Remaining everything comes in one points on 5 to take two pins float like this Okay price of HSC 84008 Sorry 8499 per subteeth 8499. Sorry? We build at 2pm. So that's the reason we came with this price and free EMI offering is going on now too Ok, but children you can negotiate a two-year deal for them I understand ma'am In these areas size of prices are only 1870 right? Yes, it comes in 1.85 to 290 here now If you are looking for 1695 then this one will be available at 20 lakhs Where do they share the location of your house ? We have Prestige Highfields is Precipica Hillcrest. Hill Cresca ? Yes ,Precicaca hill crest . Quite opposite to that. Loft I mean. As we say loft. We have the project excavation at ASDLoft and Precifica hills creste as opposed projects Okay it comes there? Yes So you have a prestige IPL account Do u know about Spectra or ASBL spectras ? I don't think of that but Hillcrest is an idea for me There's Midos right Avila idea for that too. Yes exactly! You will go back from the same lane and then you can see it. The Prestige IPL's are located at mid-house villas in backside of this building Is your office near here ? We used our sales offices to get into Sheraton Hotel ICICI Bank Sheratan hotel floor no 10 From now on site has 400m because excavation was done we shifted out sale offis This is toll free number right? share my office number okay you can save Same water pump? Yes, same. I will be sharing this. loans FBI also no? No ma'am, because APF is only with the Bajas. So we cannot go to HBA or any other branch Because you will be going for that project if there's an API same as per RBI from 8 point 4-8 points 5 it has a rate of interest It isn't like this... suppose your approval but customer can to any bank individually. If all documents and site is close then a client will be able take it fromves your projects. But loans can go to any individual banks. Is it okay if we have HMDA or RERA? We already be the tower B man. APF is not a bank. But if you want to get an API, it will take 2-3 months for the project So we came with only one Bank Bajauj They are our projects fund so they have favor and I am in favour of them There were some other banks that stopped their access through this program your APF number. If it is not the same then a project to come up. So that's why... It is important because loans are very much needed, right? Yes I understand ma'am but if we don't want more banks then the reason behind this would have been these three or four month period of time required by an apf number so since our sales and projects will start 3-4 months and we cannot wait. You can have a and Bajraj, then it will be fine. But they are waiting for us Yes ma'am we have all the... Can i ask one thing?

Ok yes Sir And another thing that you can do with this property handover comes in December 2026 Okay. You pay interest for that amount. We reimburse you 90% of the monthly loan, so if your disbursed money is 30k we will re-embrace it to a total rate 19%. That's how much ever monthly payment goes on. The entire G plus 45 has been completed till 3rd floor slab was finished So, this is the total structure of a terrestrial slab. Approximately, it will be done by 2025. In this timeline you are paying the amount to bank and we reimburse 90% of your debt If any one accumulates that money then approximately 8-10 lakhs is left for us You can use those amounts as a ratio your choice or you may even choose to have an interior. That is a benefit that we provide clients here. How much will be 8-10 lakhs till March? The percentage progress increases and so does disbursement. Accordingly, bank gives us money in terms of payment options but according 2 share properties they release 20% of the bank is released in that 40 lakhs. Then another 10%, then 60lakh and so on... So even after this progress it will increase your disbursement. You are saying only till March right? Next 2-3 months maybe. I am asking him how he is getting 3 months. So basically you pay 10% of the booking advance from your side and another 30th floor is completed then only we can give this flexibility to Bajaji. We will be able provide our offer with them How do they get interest? For example, for 20 lakhs bank You will forward that statement with our share and pay it back in this way. We are paying 90% of your amount at last month of the revenue from you. Yes! I understand why they give like this? Ok.. I understood that way to get more money. Basically many customers here belong first home buyers and buy their homes for a long time. They want EMI as well or house, it will be very difficult for many people. So we are running our offer in those areas. We run all the properties except one property here at Gachar and another on my upper floor as well called ASBL Springs & DCC. And also two other financial districts too have been ran by us over there. To give them a benefit of 3 months only ,we do runs these offers with clients. benefit. Where else in financial district? In exact Financial District, there is one more called ASPL Spectra and it has 3 types of offers 1980 2210 000 This will be handed over by December 2025 What is the profile of Ashoka Builders India Private Limited If you want to visit the site, we have a sales office in Sheraton near ICICI bank at ISB Road and will send it on location as well Is this negotiable for the price? It is non-negotiabIy. If you think of negotiation as such, we are offering free MMOs to those who want them. You can apply from 8 lakh rupees upto 10 Lakh and if 7Laks comes in that time period also even though I am doing SFT at Rs7likes but still there is not possible to get. But you are increasing 500 per500 per month. That is why i am asking We are done with 290 flats per solo type. 3 months. Then we recently did a price hike in this month to 9000 per sqft That's why I am asking, the property rate is not that fast anywhere else right? It increases by 100% sir if you see at your location it will increase every three years and then 500 more how much does one year later cost after 2 years? I am saying that because you bought it. Yes, yes..I was telling the same thing. I don't know whether they have or not but... I'm just stating there is a saturation and also asking if both will grow fast like this? It's in location sir as well. If we think about builder point of view then even next month it will be 9-10% or 10%. It doesn't impact us at all. People don' t even purchase. When there. If demand is less in market then we can't increase our inventory right? It's a loss to builders So according with Market value sir price valuation will be done by Tatyapur and as per Inventory I am also going ahead Ok so this ASBL properties have been here since 30 years where did you build the ASBL properties from 30 years ago?

96," Hello, hello. Are you from which place of India? Hyderabad sir. Can I speak in Telugu language with your help? Yes, please do so. Okay, tell me more about this project. If we are busy at office then come back to us. Our program is also project and the program also comes in financial district sir And when we come here We are constructing 4 towers of 785 acres total with Z plus 39 floors So all these were constructed using only 3BHKs With threepage case, starting SFT will be G plus 39 floors for construction Ok, now for this DC backup? Yes sir 100% dc back up is there. 100 % means including ASBs Including everything Sir At any time you can turn on all the things in your house without problem So it's a hundred percent DG Backup Yes Sir, we have one Hundred Percent of DD Back Up what is the water facility? Is there Manjeera ? Here we both offer manjira and groundwater availability without any problem. Both are available here. Okay Sir tell me about this place. The price of HFT for present time will be. 8500 per HFT and we are handling the handout date as of 2020 December. Is that a deadline given to RERA? This is our handover, sir! It will be available only for 6 months grace paid in addition to this. Okay.. So what you gave was on 20th Dec Yes we 2 crores. Apart from registration and not even final price but negotiation of prices So, the negotiation is going on definitely? You said for 1980sft including floor rise and car parking. I am telling you this after completing the registration. Sir, it is not only a Registration. Yes sir! Understood. No problem. Now presently suppose if its December 25th then there are 2 years 8 months left to book for booking. So now that we have booked how much down payment will be required? Sir if you booked it by then there is a 10% booking amount part. For example for 80 % loan which means 20%, so first of all the other ten percent are being paid to us Yes sir Another Ten Percent will get spent after the 39th floor terrace is done. That means, whichever tower you are taking a flat in that Tower gets another 30%. Then Bank M does 80 % of the time. If you increase it by 10%, then we have to pay down payment for that first month period, right? Yes sir! We will% will be deducted. After that how is the present progress? When are we going to make next payment? Sir before now when it comes in Present, 2 months to 3 month time. Ok that is what I am asking about. No problem. Now why this Gated Community? What are the nearest in Nanakramguda now ? When it comes near us... Excuse We have an ICICI bank in Nanakram, right? Yes! The ICC Bank comes just 1 km away from our project here. Okay sir If you are coming through service road of nanarkaram for example Then we will be almost two malls are coming. One is MyScape open storey and other one Western Stings The next one is the mall called Escape Open Stores. Another thing, there's a Western things Mall here. Oh okay! Yes sir and also around us we have many commercial buildings which are only up to 15 floors high. We've constructed this directly on top of the hill. So, even if it rains or is rainy season water will not come out because we are entering from road to third basement only Road level 3rd and there's 2 on top of that and there's only one ground floor below it, which means you have a single base above your street Okay okay Yes sir So what happens with this? You also need to park your car That too! And they say parking will not allow water accumulation anywhere Yeah right Sir It doesn't create any problem for us here in the country. Now there is no parking or basement for government right? Where Sir ? Is it a ground floor and above.. No Sir! As per new Govt rule they sayements should not be too thick. So what we are doing is that there will a basement and? Yes. It will come in the tilt We are coming from above ground and we have a floor on top of that two basements That means even if it's only for floors or grounds they would be flats The main motive here was to make sure that the vehicle movement does not rotate in any direction. Another thing we are doing now, parking system will be used for malls and multiplexes as well means we have given ramp for entry and exit So from basement 3, one goes to the second basement And another will go into a different room in B1 This is how your rams move. Hence it takes time only on 1st floor of basement But also same amount at 4th wall of b2b as well. To park our car. Understood you can directly visit them? Yes we will be able direct visits without any problem How many are there for each floor? Sir! We provide two varieties of this tower A and D. These 2 Towers will be 10 Flats per Floor. If you take a look at Tower B &D these both become Premium T are premium towers. These have only 5 flats for the first floor Only five floors? Yes, they all cost just Rs 500 per square feet How much is SFT price of those 2 houses you sold to us? Same prices sir! The same as that the SFT prices are same but because of this premium flats... Okay, do you mean sizes? Yes yes it is about size. The whole 4 towers have similar sized floors too Why did they put 5 for B and C per floor then Sir how does a Premium flat? Density is low. There are no 10 flats on the floor and 5 flat floors so density will be less which means crowdedness would reduce Second thing you get complete U-shaped ventilation Even if it's a middle slat 1980sft or any other even then corner of that comes with equal since we are giving a good view side, it will be little about this place. Next month is our visit to Hyderabad and that's why i started my enquiries Sir if it comes next Month... don't mistake me. The price will increase from next month in our project because we are running the same rate since March and February as well which is Rs 2500 here So what it means now? Price won' t be increasing Sir next month 1st. We can assume that it should be my price? First off our flag must look good. After liking, then we decide on its orientation according to our requirement. Price is not that much important criteria If it is present, sir. There's only one flat Sir 2220SFT which means bigger Sft So almost two-thirds construction has started I told you right? Tower C and outside view of the tower is in a flat shape. There are 1980s SFT's on this side and west facing ones as well. From here, you can see exactly our clubhouse from where we came to now. We could expand 200m till entry gate for Club house through that Tower And then 100 feet long. So, we are almost 300 ft away from the gate opposite to our school building. There's a normal street connecting Keystone International School with this area. You'll get an entire month of financial district view in 1980s SFT. I will send you the details in whatsapp. You said that depends upon flag size, there can be basic price negotiation right? Yes sir Which flags are you selecting? We will negotiate accordingly as you are trying to give us the token amount soon. To From there, we have 10-15 days time to pay remaining 10% of the loan. In these times our bank and login details are available only till then before agreement sale happens if there is will return this amount pattern with zero cuttings The second thing is what's an offer? This name means pre EMI. You have to go through the completion of 39th floor terrace and returns back to us. Okay! This is also a monthly return for this account. The monthly interest will be reimbursed and 90% of the return is detected under T will pay this amount part in registration so what happens when you do the payment is that then also, it becomes possible to meet with them if someone comes and buys a flat from us they too would have amount. We have transfer clause which changes our name to their names, we can use that for paying them back in 250 rupees For example if I get 15 lakhs as pre-missed scheme Even though it is 3 or 5 lacs transfer clause in that amount then another 10lakh is like a save age for us. Yes. The remaining people who are buying will keep the registration part or else even though it's our own flat is also done, that means we are new after the separation of our separate parts only for inter 1186 if we remove 150-200 mortgages then there is a value for just these 85 flat 150 to 200 pieces now, but present 87 flats are available. So almost of them available in Alaska... Yes! In any current topic or availability.. please tell us about it as well. Definitely i'll give a link to your availabilty sheet on WhatsApp. If we get those links then its easy to start out. Definitely sir, I'll send you a quotation for this flat also. Sir is it.
